                Our dog of the week is always featured on our websites background. This week we are delighted to show
                everyone ROCKO! Rocko first came to us from a family who found him on the side of the road. The family
                fostered him for a few weeks until he was able to find a loving family :-)

                I give Pets-R-Us a rating of five out of five. While we were away on vacation they kept us in the loop
                how
                our little pooch was doing. We came back from our vacation stress free and happy to know our pet was in
                good
                hands.

                We have been coming to Pet-R-Us for the last five years. Are families have had such a wonderful time
                with
                all the trainers and care takers.

                When we first moved here we didn't have many options for places to take our pets. Now when we go on our
                long
                trips we have the peace of mind that our 10yr old sheep dog is well taken care of,
